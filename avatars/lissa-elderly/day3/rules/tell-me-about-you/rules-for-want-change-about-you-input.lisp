;; MEETING WITH KIM NOTES (8/4/2017)

;; Be more outgoing
;; Excersize more
;; Eat healthy
;; Spend more time with my grandchildren/spouse/kids
;; They isolate and want to get out of their house more
;; Negative outlook; being pessimistic
;; Lose weight
;; Manage money better

;; Might get confused and interpret as "what you would want to be different about your life"
;; hear better, better health, not need a wheelchare, have better hearing, not live in a nursing home, be able to drive, see better, etc.
