;; MEETING WITH KIM NOTES (8/8/2017)

;; Those prefer to live in house if they live in senior living: call it cottage.
;; House on campus,
;; Senior housing: most live in apartment
;; Live with their children
;; Children want them to give up their house so people wanna stay at their home alap -> not a good idea
;; Difficulty with stairs,
;; Moving out from house to apt. because of these things -> it was hard to give up home
;; Sometimes couples-> one stay home, the other nursing home -> get split up
