;; *have-rochester2-dialog*: development version 5 (UNDER CONSTRUCTION)
;;
;; After defining *have-rochester2-dialog*, we create a hash table 
;;       *output-semantics* 
;; containing interpretations of Lissa outputs, under hash keys 
;; like (*have-rochester2-dialog* ?e1). The main goal is to be able later
;; to match certain user inputs to question interpretations, to
;; see if the inputs already answer the questions, making them
;; redundant.

; LISSA introduces herself, sets the scene, asks about the user's 
; major, responds to the user's reply, and starts the "Rochester"
; part of the dialog.

; In future, I expect something closer to the following for the
; initial LISSA dialog schema; the acions would be matched and 
; elaborated into text by a language generator:
;  (^me explain-to.v ^you ((nnp lissa) ((nn dialog) framework.n)))
;  (^me tell.v ^you (my academic-major.n))
;  (^me ask.v ^you (id-of (your academic-major.n)))
;  ...
; But since the eventual EL representation allows for quoting, 
; we can make life easy for ourselves at first.

; I'm not sure if the speech generator makes use of upper-/lower-case
; distinctions. If so, we'll eventually have to use character-string
; output here, and a tokenizer that changes this to special Lisp atoms
; like |Hi| I |am| |Lissa|, ... (Using ~a rather than ~s in format
; statements will output such atoms without the escape characters.)
; Note: Lisp atoms with an internal or final '.' are ok, but commas
; and semicolons are not allowed without a preceding '\' or in a |...|
; context.

:episodes ( ; we start execution at this keyword
         ; (I've omitted other schema components for the time being.)
         ; Lissa's lengthy initial utterance may eventually be broken into
         ; a few higher-level (nonprimitive) actions such as introducing
         ; herself, the purpose and structure of the dialog, and the 
         ; explanation of the icons, with each nonprimitive action broken 
         ; down in turn into a number of (primitive) saying-acts.

; There seem to be two alternative ways of supplying semantics for
; Lissa's outputs. The first is to assume that our dialog schema
; supplies English outputs directly via quotation, as is currently
; done. The second is to assume that dialog schemas in general
; specify what to do as logical formulas -- which are then rendered
; into verbal output via schemas, world knowledge, and knowledge
; of English (esp. structuring knowledge for output, and surface
; generation). In the latter case, the plan itself already supplies
; the semantics of what is to be said, and which is used as basis
; for generating output. 
;
; Since the current method is the former one, here is an attempt 
; to supply meaning representations for the steps. 
;
; [But even that is rather premature -- for interpreting a user input
; in light of a prior Lissa output, we're currently assuming that the
; "interpretations" of the outputs are just English "gist" clauses,
; plus perhaps additional clauses (as word lists). For example, 
; ?e3below ends with "how about you?", so a suitable gist clause
; would be (What is your major ?), which is quite adequate for 
; guiding the pattern matching in "interpreting" the user's reply
; (such as "I'm in physics", yielding (I am a physics major)). So
; we also specify ]
