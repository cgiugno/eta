;; "choose-reaction-to-input.lisp" (for single gist clause inputs)
;; ===============================================================
;; File for choosing a reaction to a feature-augmented gist
;; clause extracted from a user's answer to a question. In
;; general, the gist clause is expected to provide sufficient
;; information to allow choice of a comment (if warranted) from
;; Lissa, based on choice trees for specific answers, thematic
;; answers, and potentially a final question in the gist
;; clause list.
;;
;; This packet is for single clauses -- see 
;;     "choose-reactions-to-input.lisp"
;; (note the plural) for a packet that makes a choice of a schema
;; depending on multiple gist clauses extracted from the user 
;; input -- but realizing the steps of the schema again depend
;; on the choice packet in this file, and the choice trees 
;; referenced here.
;; 
;; The gist clause input is expected to be of the (at least
;; approximate) form currently constructed by the choice trees
;; for extracting gist clauses from user input, specifically
;; the inputs responsing to the questions (as gist clauses)
;;
;;	What changes might happen for you in the next few years ?
;;  What is the hardest part of growing older ?
;;  What is the best part of growing older ?
