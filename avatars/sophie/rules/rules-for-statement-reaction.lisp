(READRULES '*reaction-to-statement*
; Here we match any non-question statements which the user might ask, and respond to them appropriately.
; If some topic has enough possible gist clauses where it gets messy to put them all here, we can branch off
; to a subtree defined in the rule file for that subtopic (e.g. with *general-reaction*).
; NOTE: questions in declarative form might be tricky, and seem to happen frequently enough in the transcripts.
; Will have to figure out whether to make those questions beforehand through some preprocessing step (I think
; this makes more sense) or deal with them here somehow.
