;; July, 11/19: define the schema *reactions-to-spatial-question*
;; ================================================================
;; 
;; This is intended to "work" for one or more non-question gist 
;; clauses followed by a final gist-clause question.
;;
;; The idea is to react to the question first, followed by "so" 
;; (as a new-topic-initiation signal), followed by a reaction to
;; the initial gist clause. (So this schema ignores any intermediate
;; clauses.) 
;;
;; An alternative would be to react to the initial gist clause
;; first, followed by "As for your question," or something similar;
;; in general, it seems to require stronger discourse signals to
;; get back to an unanswered question than to get back to another
;; component of the user's input. Also, this would work well for 
;; question-deflection responses by Eta like "Let's keep the 
;; focus on you". Anyway, in future, we might provide multiple
;; applicable schemas in "choose-reactions-to-input.lisp", and
;; choose from these (via a small choice tree, even if only to
;; vary response styles by using non-zero latency?)
