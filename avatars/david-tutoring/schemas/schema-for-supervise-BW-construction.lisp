; Blocks world structure building supervision; such a session is expected to
; consist of the agent (given a goal representation) supervising the user building
; the chosen goal structure, fielding any questions along the way, and issuing
; corrections when the user makes a wrong move (according to the planner input
; after each step), and terminating once the goal representation is created.
;
; NOTE: currently this is exactly the same as the guide-BW-construction.v schema,
; except minor differences in some of the speech outputs by David, and David
; instantiates the supervise-BW-action.v schema instead of guide-BW-action.v.
