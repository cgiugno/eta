; Blocks world concept tutoring session; such a session is expected to consist
; of the agent selecting a concept for which it has a concept schema, guiding 
; the user in the construction of instances of this concept, providing corrective
; feedback, and terminating when the user appears to understand the concept
; (or chooses to end the interaction). Some "small talk" may occur (currently
; disabled).

  ; go through multiple cycles of building extensions (e.g., first building a
  ; taller one, then building a wider one, etc.) before understanding it.
  ; Second, the BW system currently only supports the extensions "bigger" and
  ; "smaller", which are tried as alternatives. Ultimately, a number of types of
  ; extensions should be supported (like "taller", "longer", "wider", "diagonal", etc.),
  ; and they should be parsed directly from user input (or from David's selection) and
  ; used in the form-spatial-representation.v episode.
