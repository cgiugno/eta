;; Feb 4/2020
;; ================================================
;;
;; This code is used to generate a response to a spatial query,
;; given a list of propositional answer relations with certainties.
;;
;; The general process is to categorize each query into one of a small
;; set of general question categories, such as "confirm" (yes/no question),
;; "ident" (what question), "descr" (where question), etc. This category is
;; used to form an appropriate answer ULF fragment (such as simple yes/no for
;; "confirm", a noun phrase for "ident", a set of prepositional phrases for "descr",
;; etc.). This answer ULF is then substituted in for the appropriate constituent in
;; the query ULF, such as what.pro/(what.d block.n) in the case of "ident".
;;
;; After this substitution, the modified query ULF is uninverted by applying all
;; sub operators and removing redundant auxiliaries to form the response ULF.
;; Certain pragmatic modifications are made at this point, chiefly checking for
;; and responding to presupposition failure using the ulf-pragmatics library.
