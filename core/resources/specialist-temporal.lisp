;; Functions to help Eta work with time, such as comparisons, relation-checking,
;; and maintaining/updating knowledge of time.
;; TODO: clean up preposition/adverb definitions by factoring out mod-a conditional into
;; function, and passing all functions as keyword arguments.
;; TODO: the numerical predicates in here should eventually be replaced with general versions
;; so that any number is recognized and processed correctly. I have to think more about how to do this.
