(defun readrules (rootname packet)

; This reads in the set of decomposition and output rules. 
; It embeds these rules in a tree whose root node is 'rootname',
; and where first children are reached via the 'children' property,
; and children are connected via the 'next' property. Rule node
; names are generated by GENSYM. Decomposition and output patterns
; are stored under the 'pattern' property, and output rules are
; distinguished by having a non-NIL 'directive' property.
;
; READRULES also puts a numerical property called 'latency' 
; on the property list of output rules. This is the number
; of outputs that must be generated before the rule can be
; used again. As indicated below, in the data set the numeric
; value of latency and the directive symbol are supplied jointly
; as a 2-element list, but these become separate properties
; in the choice tree that is built.
;
; 'Packet' is of form (depth pattern optional-pair
;	                depth pattern optional-pair ...)
; where "depth" is a number =1 for top-level rules, =2 for
; direct descendants of top-level rules, etc.; "pattern" is
; a decomposition pattern or other output; and optional-pair
; is present iff "pattern" is a reassembly pattern or other 
; output. The first element of optional-pair, if present, is 
; the latency of the rule. The second element (the directive
; symbol) is :out (for reassembly), :subtree (for continuing
; recursion in a subtree), :subtrees (for a list of subtrees
; to be returned as output), :subtree+clause (for a recursive
; continuation where a choice tree root plus a clause constructed
; by a reassembly rule are used), :schema (when the output is
; the name of a schema), :schema+args (when the schema name is 
; accompanied by an argument list whose elements depend on
; reassembly), and :gist (when the output is a decontextualized
; user sentence -- a "gist clause").
