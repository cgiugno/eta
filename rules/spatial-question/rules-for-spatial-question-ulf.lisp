; "rules-for-spatial-questions.lisp"  -- currently under revision, June 21/19
; from previous version (v6). Add "between" rules. That's a bit tricky,
; because the complement of "between" either can be a plural ("between two
; red blocks") or a full NP conjunction ("between a red block and a blue
; block"), or a conjunction with ellipsis ("between a red and a blue
; block"; "between the Toyota and the SRI block"; "between the Toyota
; and SRI blocks").
;
; One issue is that to allow for names like "Burger King", we currently 
; need to preprocess to change this to "Burger_King". Would an alternative
; be to introduce features 'name-part1', 'name-part2, ..., which apply to
; parts of a multiword name, where single-word names have feature 'name',
; *as well as* feature 'name-part1'? Can we introduce a mini-grammar for
; names whose use is triggered by feature 'name-part1', and that allows
; a word with feature 'name' as a name, and allows appropriate sequences
; of words with features 'name-part1', 'name-part2, ... as names? But we
; can't do that via 'eval-lex-ulf', because this assumed we know for sure
; that the word(s) supplied can be of the specified category -- which we
; can't be sure of, just given features 'name-part1', 'name-part2, ... .
; So the grammar itself would need to check for particular word sequences,
; which would really be very inelegant, and infeasible for realistically
; large sets of names.
;
; Short of switching from single-word features (for pattern matching)
; to features assigned to word sequences (possible in TTT, I suppose),
; I think preprocessing is the best option. This might be done via the 
; gist clause mechanism, as part of "repairing" the user's word sequence
; as produced by the speech recognizer. Repairs are extremely context/
; domain-specific, but then that's also true for gist clause determination
; in general.
; 
;
; TODO: Some examples of references that might be more difficult to handle
; "The furthest one"
; "What about the McDonalds block"
; etc.
;
; "Does the SRI block have a block [on top of][above] it?"
; "Does a block touch the SRI block"
; "Does there exist a block on the SRI block"
; "What is the color of the block ..."
; "Is there a red block that is on the Twitter block" >> CRASHES
; ""

;; NB: All questions are expected to have a separate question mark at the end;
;;     If necessary, prior input processing of the user input (as supplied -- 
;;     somewhat unreliably -- by the speech recognizer) should separate off
;;     or add a question mark, when the input seems to be in the form of 
;;     a question (typically starting with a be-word, a wh-word, or a prep-
;;     osition plus wh-word)
;;
;; NB: :ulf-recur rules specify 2 reassembly patterns -- one for the successive
;;     parts, and one for putting the ULFs for the parts together with the 
;;     correct bracketing; (:ulf rules specify just the ulf assembly patterns).
;;
;;     The first of these reassembly patterns needs to be a list of any of
;;     the following 3 sorts of components:
;;     - an atom, which will be used as-is in the second reassembly pattern;
;;     - a triple (lex-ulf! <lex-cat> <part number>) which will (later) be
;;       evaluated into a lexical ULF atom or ULF expression;
;;     - a pattern of form (<name of a rule-tree> <itm1> <itm2> ...) where
;;       the <itmj> elements are typically integers indicating parts, but
;;       can also be arbitrary expressions, potentially containing integers
;;       indicating parts.
;;
;;     The second reassembly pattern just specifies how the "pieces" 
;;     (top-level components) in the first reassembly pattern should be 
;;     bracketed to yield the final ULF form (once the components of type
;;     (<name of a rule-tree> <itm1> <itm2> ...) have been recursively
;;     evaluated). It could also introduce additional ULF expressions,
;;     but for readability usually shouldn't, unless material needs to be
;;     added that doesn't fit with the syntactic constraints on types of
;;     components in the first reassembly pattern, as enumerated above.
;;     
;;     The expressions of form (lex-ulf! <lex-cat> <part number>) in the
;;     resulting ULF are evaluated as a final step in the program 
;;     'choose-result-for1', which interprets the directives.
